The general rules of conduct are:

* Code identation is 4 spaces NO TABS
* Function parameters start at column 48, one param per line
* Use inside-code gtk doc documentation for everything 
* Do not put documentation outside of the code
* Use g_assert's inside private functions where it makes sense (they're not
  compiled-in by default)
* Put space to separate operators. Ie:

{
    some_function (param1, param2);
    a = 1 + 2;
    b [1] = 10;
}

NEVER EVER DO:

{
    some_function(param1,param2);
    a=1+2;
    b[1]=10;
}

* Small testing programs can be put in the examples/ directory. They can be run
  without installation blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  
* Obey the rules present in the existing code base -- it's pretty consistent
* Use ONE blank line to separate things
