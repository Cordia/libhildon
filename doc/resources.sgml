<title>Filing a bug report or feature request</title>

<para>
If you encounter a bug, misfeature, or missing feature in Hildon, please
file a bug report on
<ulink url="http://bugs.maemo.org">http://bugs.maemo.org</ulink>. File those
against the "hildon-libs" component of the "Desktop Platform".
</para>

<para>
Don't hesitate to file a bug report, even if you think we may know
about it already, or aren't sure of the details. Just give us as much
information as you have, and if it's already fixed or has already been
discussed, we'll add a note to that effect in the report.
</para>

<para>
The bug tracker should definitely be used for feature requests, it's
not only for bugs. We track all Hildon development in Bugzilla, so it's
the way to be sure the Hildon developers won't forget about an issue.

<title>Submitting Patches</title>

<para>
If you develop a bugfix or enhancement for Hildon, please file that in
Bugzilla as well. Bugzilla allows you to attach files; please attach a
patch generated by the <command>diff</command> utility, using the
<option>-u</option> option to make the patch more readable. All patches
must be offered under the terms of the GNU LGPL license, so be sure you
are authorized to give us the patch under those terms.
</para>

<para>
If you want to discuss your patch before or after developing it, mail
<ulink url="mailto:maemo-developers@maemo.org">maemo-developers@maemo.org</ulink>.
But be sure to file the Bugzilla report as well; if the patch is only on the
list and not in Bugzilla, it's likely to slip through the cracks.
