  * Fixed #8557: Even after muting the audio Seek bar thumb progressess
    and after that unmute also mute mark enabled
  * hildon-volumebar.c:
  * - The 'keyboard' navigation was made possible by enabling the mute
    button to get focus. The icon for the focused button was set to the
    same as mute icon because the mute button can have focus only when
    volume is muted. After the volume was unmuted, the focus for mute
    button was disabled and focus grabbed for the volumebar. If the
    volumebar was unable to get focus, the mute button didn't lose focus
    and a wrong icon was displayed -> fixed by adding a check if
    volumebar can indeed focus and choosing the action based on that
    information.
