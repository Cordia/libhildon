/**
 * SECTION:hildon-animation-window
 * @short_description: Widget representing an animation actor for
 * WM-assisted animation effects in the Hildon framework.
 *
 * The #HildonAnimationActor is a GTK+ widget which represents an
 * animation actor for WM-assisted animation effects in the Hildon
 * framework. It derives from #GtkWindow and can host any widgets much
 * like a normal window. The special features available to the
 * animation actor is the ability to set its position, scale factor
 * and rotation. These parameters are interpreted by Hildon's
 * compositing window manager to alter the on-screen representation of
 * the animation actor window. Bear in mind, however, that by design
 * decision, animation actors are not reactive -- the widgets placed
 * in such window will not receive keyboard, motion or button
 * events. Animation actors are input-transparent -- the input events
 * will be sent to the underlying real windows and widgets.
 *
 * The animation actors may exist in a parented or an unparented
 * state. To be displayed, animations actors must be parented to
 * another top-level window widget. Animation actors display on top
 * (in front) of the standard window contents unless the position
 * (depth, z-coordinate) is specifically adjusted. Animation actors in
 * an unparented state do not display at all.
 *
 * Parented animation actors are placed in the coordinate space of the
 * parent window and visually become a part of the parent window
 * iteslf -- they inherit the transformations and effects enforced by
 * the window manager on the parent window (task switcher animations,
 * minimize events, etc.).
 *
 * All animation actor settings (position, scale, rotation, opacity,
 * depth) can be applied to unparented actors, but will only take
 * effect as the actor is parented to a top-level window and that
 * window is shown. All settings are preserved during
 * unparenting/reparenting.
 *
 * The #HildonAnimationActor API closely follows the #ClutterActor
 * API.  Please take a look at the #ClutterActor description for the
 * modelview transformations order that applies to
 * HildonAnimationActor and ClutterActor alike.
 *
 * Animation actor widget controls the animation actor as it is
 * transformed by the window manager using ClientMessage X11
 * events. It tries to minimize the amount of such events and couples
 * conceptually related parameters (visibility and opacity, position
 * and depth) to the same message.  The API, however, offers
 * convenience functions for the programmer to be able to modify every
 * parameter individually.
